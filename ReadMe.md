Before running the program, take note that all .csv files are to be placed in the campaign/testfiles folder, as the program finds the .csv files in that directory.

To run the program, ensure that you are in the /campaign folder on your command line, before typing the command:
> java -jar testapp.jar

You will then be prompted to enter the first file name. 
> (E.g sample_file_1.csv)

Finally, you will be prompted to enter the second file name to be compared to.
> (E.g sample_file_3.csv)

If there are no errors, the output file, output.csv, will be exported to campaign/testfiles/output.csv
